To Play The Game Is Simple.

All You Juust Have To Do Is;

1. Press Any Key On Your Keyboard To Start The Game.
2. The Computer Would Click On A Color, Then You Should Click On That Also. 
If The Color Matches With What The Computer Picked, Then You've just Completed Level 1.
3. Level 2 is a bit more challengingg because when the computer picks a new color,
you would have to click on the previous color of level 1 with the current color of
level 2 that the computer picked. So that means in level 2 you would be pick TWO colors 
instead of ONE.
4. That is how the game would be played with in subsequent levels, so level 3, you would
pick THREE colors(2 from the previous levels in ORDER and ONE from the current level).
5. I hope you have FUN with it and play it with friends and family.
